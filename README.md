# Maligayang Pagdating! üëãÔ∏è

I am Ned Palacios, a 20-year-old developer currently living in Davao City, Philippines. My primary focus is building stuff on the web and working part-time for the [V Programming Language](https://github.com/vlang/v). I'm also enrolled as a freshman BS Computer Science student at the [University of Immaculate Conception](https://uic.edu.ph). On my free time, I watch Korean dramas and animes, as well as read mangas. That's all :)
